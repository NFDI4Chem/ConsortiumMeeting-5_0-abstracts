This work presents the recent updates that have been incorporated, along with upcoming features nearing completion. Until now, samples in the Chemotion ELN were categorized as single molecules. While this was adequate for many research purposes, it needed to cover the variety of sample types found in modern chemical research, including mixtures, polymers, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Thus, the sample type extension feature aims to expand Chemotion ELN\'s functionality by implementing a thorough sample classification system that will enable more precise classification and management of various chemical entities, including mixtures, polymers, MOFs, and other complex sample types. With that aim, we have introduced a new sample type called "Mixture". The goal is to allow researchers to combine multiple samples or molecules into mixtures, track individual components, and perform necessary calculations related to concentrations, volumes, and other parameters.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(a.p,{children:"The upgraded Spectra Viewer allows ELN\u2019s admin to configure the missing layout types in *.jdx, *.dx files that ELN supported, e.g., \u201cXRD\u201d for X-RAY DIFFRACTION.
