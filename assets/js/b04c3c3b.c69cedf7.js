This adaptability allows scientists to design and integrate new modules seamlessly, optimizing the management of materials, samples, and workflows. Additionally, Chemotion LabIMotion promotes collaborative research by enabling the effortless sharing of templates and synchronization across different applications through Chemotion LabIMotion Template Hub, which has been synchronized more than 300 times across the Chemotion ELN instances."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"With Chemotion LabIMotion, scientists act as designers, creating custom templates tailored to their specific needs. Each template can incorporate over 20 different components and settings, and an interactive diagram tool is provided to support workflow construction.
