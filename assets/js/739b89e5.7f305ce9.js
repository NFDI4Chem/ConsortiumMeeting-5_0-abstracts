Security assignment mechanism will be implemented. For new devices documentation and LADS will be provided.Large data will be linked to the original source and captured relevant metadata has to be extracted. The software will be extended by open-source components. Strategies will be generalized and consolidated to use features in different contexts. A data manager will be built in the ELN including an UI to manage the data analysis workflow.\nTo coordinate developers from different universities, tasks will be planned and code will be reviewed. Users report issues and bugs via GitHub. CI and CD will be implemented. New features will be documented and released. An automated monitoring will be implemented to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities of the ELN dependencies. Various extensions will be implemented and improvements for user experience (like a better UI) will be provided. TA4 and TA5 will be further supported. New APIs (i.a. a Python API Client for Chemotion ELN) will be implemented for Third-Party-Apps, Theoretical chemistry workflows, Databases and AI-based tools. An open-source inventory solution is planned to register and manage chemicals as well as mandatory standards include tracking for all components and electronic Signatures.\nChemotion is expanding its collaboration with open-source projects to enhance its platform.
