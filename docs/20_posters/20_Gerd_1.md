The IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) is advancing rapidly: The development has been moved to GitHub to improve transparency and collaboration and a new version, 1.07, was released in July 2024. Several working groups are pushing forward InChI-based resources and applications in reactions, mixtures, extended stereochemistry, tautomers, organometallics, molecular inorganics, polymers, nanomaterials, isotopologues, macromolecules, QR codes, and Markush. Some of these projects will change the core InChI itself, others are building applications on top of core InChI functionality, and the rest develop InChI-related services. This poster will outline the current state of the InChI and the increased functionality which will soon be available as well as ways to participate in the InChI development process.
