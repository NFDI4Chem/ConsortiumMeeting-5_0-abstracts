The IAM4NFDI initiative is focused on connecting and expanding Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems to enable researchers from various domains and institutions to effortlessly access digital resources within NFDI, while also facilitating interaction with external infrastructures and resources through a decentralized, federated IAM. This is achieved through the implementation of Community Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI).


NFDI4Chem is actively contributing to this initiative by working towards a unified login system across its services within the consortium.


The primary goal is to implement a unified AAI solution, allowing users seamless access to all available resources with a single login, thereby eliminating the need for multiple accounts across NFDI4Chem services. The community AAI supports both OIDC and OAuth2.0, enabling the creation of groups and sub-groups for accessing specialized service features.


Although currently limited to the consortium, this service is planned to expand in the future to support cross-consortium access.
