**Advancing the Federated Repositories in NFDI4Chem**

Building on the progress made in the NFDI4Chem consortium, Task Area 3 (Repositories) continues its mission to develop a federated system of chemistry repositories for the collection, management, and re-use of research data. In 2024, our focus is on enhancing the federation by implementing robust metadata standards, APIs, protocols, and community-driven vocabularies and ontologies. Following the initial repository selection, we are expanding our efforts to onboard additional repositories that meet the evolving standards of NFDI4Chem.

Throughout the past year, we have collaborated closely with repository partners to refine technical interoperability, with many repositories making significant strides towards better compliance to our standards. The TA3 team has conducted comprehensive evaluations to identify gaps in data type coverage and has worked with repository leaders to address these gaps through targeted adaptations or, when needed, the onboarding of new repositories.

Our approach includes ongoing gap analyses, community engagement, and the establishment of clear criteria for assessing repository readiness. By focusing on operational readiness and the technical requirements needed for integration, we aim to ensure that each repository within the federation meets the highest standards of data accessibility and usability.

The poster will present an updated overview of the federated repositories as planned for the secound funding period, highlighting new integrations, ongoing challenges, and the roadmap for continued improvement. It will showcase how NFDI4Chem is evolving to meet the needs of the chemistry community by fostering a connected, interoperable network of research data repositories.
