JASON is vendor-agnostic, post-acquisition NMR software developed by
JEOL, designed to support all NMR data from benchtop to high-field.
JASON offers an intuitive platform for comprehensive data processing and
analysis. In this workshop, we will demonstrate the software's
versatility in handling various NMR data tasks, including importing,
processing, analysing, assigning, and reporting. This demonstration will
include some of JASON's powerful features, such as automated peak
picking, multiplet analysis, quantitative NMR via the SMILEQ plugin,
fast NUS processing, and curve fitting for arrayed data.\
We will also show how JASON's Rules can be used to easily automate the
processing, analysis, and layout of reports.
