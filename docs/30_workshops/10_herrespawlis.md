# Praktical RDM in University Education

#### Sonja Herres-Pawlis and others

##### RWTH Aachen

###### E-Mail: 

After 4 years of NFDI4Chem, we would like to collect examples where RDM is successfully brought into university education. Moreover, we would like to discuss challenges where NFDI4Chem can help or where other stakeholders should help to anchor RDM better in curricular teaching. We plan to write a perspective piece out of these discussions.
