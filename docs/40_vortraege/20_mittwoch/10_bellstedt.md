Dynamic changes in the secondary structure content of proteins can
provide valuable insights into protein function or dysfunction.
Predicting these dynamic changes is still a significant challenge but
is of paramount importance for basic research as well as drug
development. Here, we present a machine learning-based model that
predicts the secondary structure content of proteins based on their
unassigned 1H,15N-HSQC NMR spectra. Our model has been implemented
into an easy-to-use and publicly available web service that estimates
secondary structure content based on a provided peak list.
Furthermore, a Python version is provided, ready to be integrated into
Bruker's TopSpin software or own scripts.
