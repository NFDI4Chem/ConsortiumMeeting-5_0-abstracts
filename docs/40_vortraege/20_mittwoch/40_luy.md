The talk will have two parts, which both relate to pulse sequence
analysis: in the first part the program PulseAnalyzer will be introduced
that allows the characterization of shaped pulses. It is similar to the
shape tool (stdisp) of Topspin, but contains far more analysis options.
In the second part an update regarding BROCODE decoupling is given as
well as very latest results regarding heteronuclear decoupling analysis
with regard to J-coupling dependence.
