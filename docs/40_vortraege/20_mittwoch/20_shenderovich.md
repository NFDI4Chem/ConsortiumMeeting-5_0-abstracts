This presentation addresses the utilization of NMR chemical shifts to
investigate noncovalent interactions in both solutions and solid states.
The exploration of these interactions through experimental NMR chemical
shifts, coupled with DFT calculations, reveals several key challenges.

Firstly, the conversion of theoretically calculated NMR shieldings into
the experimental chemical shift scale requires knowledge of the absolute
shielding of a reference molecule. This issue is discussed using
examples from <sup>31</sup>P [1] and <sup>15</sup>N [2] NMR.

Secondly, determining the minimum needed size of model systems for
calculations and accounting for external environmental influences are
crucial aspects. For most systems, clear requirements exist, including
an accurate geometry, the utilization of the Polarizable Continuum Model
approximation, and consideration of all direct non-covalent interactions
involving the NMR-active nucleus or fragments electronically conjugated
with it. However, for molecular systems with highly polarizable electron
density, these criteria prove insufficient. The addition of an external
electric field becomes necessary, albeit its value must be determined
through alternative means [3,4].

Finally, the presentation addresses the need for relativistic
corrections in DFT calculations of NMR chemical shifts, specifically in
coordination complexes involving heavy metals. Such corrections are
unnecessary for elements from the first to the third rows of the
periodic table, provided they are not covalently bonded to heavy
elements. However, for elements from the fifth period and beyond, these
corrections are deemed indispensable [5,6].
