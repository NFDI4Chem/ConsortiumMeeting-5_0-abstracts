In answering analytical questions in chemistry and material science,
solid-state NMR can make profound contributions. However, it may require
access to instruments of very different kind, and require specialist
skills in running experiments, data analysis and interpretation.

For example, studying a paramagnetic transition-metal loaded zeolite for
heterogeneous catalysis would probably start with quantitative <sup>29</sup>Si
Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR acquired with in a 300 or 400
MHz (<sup>1</sup>H equivalent) magnet of general availability, benefit from
<sup>27</sup>Al solid-state NMR of the precursor at multiple fields above 800
MHz, possibly GHz, for quantification and Al-siting analysis in
combination with DFT-calculation, further benefit from (<sup>27</sup>Al,<sup>29</sup>Si)
correlation spectroscopy under cryogenic temperature and maybe
DNP-enhancement; and possibly further from fast-MAS at 100 or 200 MHz to
characterize the active center in presence of paramagnetic states of the
active species. The same can be said about other complex systems, such
as battery materials, certain polymeric materials, formulations, etc.

Initiating cooperations with large-scale facilities can be a
time-consuming task for scientists whose focus is the chemistry as such
and who do might not have a large personal NMR network, as well as for
their local analytical partners who may be skilled in the arts of NMR
but not in possession of the required hardware. In stark contrast,
synchrotron X-ray facilities offer easy access for public- and
private-track beam time.

In this presentation, we will present PANACEA [1], the Pan-European
solid-state NMR Infrastructure for Chemistry-Enabling Access. It is a
multi-year project funded by our European Union to establish a virtual
large-scale infrastructure which is readily accessible by researchers
with and without solid-state NMR background. For example, solid-state
NMR experts can use it to easily access instruments of special kind,
solution-state NMR experts can extend their analytical portfolio without
the cost and burden of maintaining a dedicated solid-state NMR
instrument, and non-NMR experts can find contacts for analytical
services as well as full-scale cooperations. PANACEA offers Joint
Research Activities, Trans-national Access, and Networking Activities.
