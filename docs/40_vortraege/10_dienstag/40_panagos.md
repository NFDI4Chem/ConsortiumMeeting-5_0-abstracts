Introducing automation in analyses has been the focus of both consumers
and developers during the past couple of decades. Millions of euros are
being spent every year to achieve the goal of Industry 4.0, while
academic institutions develop in-house solutions to improve their
workflows.

and developers, many analytical workflows remain predominantly manual.
This presentation aims to identify the factors contributing to the
partial adoption of automation in analytics, through examining real-
examples utilizing Mnova automation alongside manual workflows.
