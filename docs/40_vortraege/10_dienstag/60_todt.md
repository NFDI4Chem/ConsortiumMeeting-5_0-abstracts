While launching a 90 MHz Benchtop NMR spectrometer with very high
resolution and multi-nuclear probes, another step to further improve NMR
performance on the bench has been taken. While many nuclei can be
accessed at the touch of a button, the spectrometer has the highest
sensitivity that also enables advanced (NUS) experiments, such as
HSQC-ME, to be acquired in just 2 minutes. With the unparalleled
resolution of the Halbach magnet, highly efficient solvent suppression
is enabled, making it possible to measure samples in protonated solvents
as they come from a reactor. Typical X-nuclei to be measured within 1D
or 2D homo- and/or hetero-nuclear pulse sequences are for instance <sup>13</sup>C,
<sup>31</sup>P, <sup>7</sup>Li, <sup>29</sup>Si, <sup>11</sup>B and <sup>15</sup>N – advanced NMR users may even write their
own pulse programs while the Spinsolve standard software allows to run
all those sequences at the touch of a button within a very user-friendly
and intuitive GUI.

Thanks to the compactness, portability, self-shielding and the highly
advanced tempering concept of these NMR systems, a wide range of
applications e.g. on-line monitoring of chemical reactions or qNMR
studies are possible as the NMR spectrometers can directly be installed
next to the chemical reactors in the Chemistry lab or even in production
sites \[1,2\].

In this presentation, we will discuss the significance of effective
solvent suppression, which, when combined with an external hardware
lock, allows for measurements without the necessity of deuterated
solvents. Additionally, we will explore typical setups for reaction
monitoring and how solvent suppression techniques can be implemented
online, using the example of coupling an H-Cube flow reactor with a
Spinsolve benchtop NMR for the rapid optimization of hydrogenation
reactions.
